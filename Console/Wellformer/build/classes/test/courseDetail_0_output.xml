    <summary/>
    <description>This course aims to teach everyone the basics of
        programming computers using Python. We cover the
        basics of how one constructs a program from a series
        of simple instructions in Python. The course has no
        pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest
        mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer
        experience should be able to master the materials in
        this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of
        the textbook “Python for Everybody”. Once a student
        completes this course, they will be ready to take
        more advanced programming courses. This course
        covers Python 3.</description>
